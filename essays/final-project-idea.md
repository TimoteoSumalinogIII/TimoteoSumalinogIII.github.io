## Overview
The problem: One thing that I noticed that the people of Hawaii lack communication. Issues arise each day and people across the island are sometimes
not informed. Furthermore, people don't express their opinions as much throughout our community. Also, we all know that Hawaii's cost of living is really
expensive, thus having people post freelance work can possibly combat this. Overall, more communication throughout our community will allow us to resolve to stay informed of local trends, issues,and opportunities and overall feel like one big Ohana.


The solution: A community-based platform that host forms and blogs that local Hawaiian people can post and review, to encourage other community to be more interactive. 

## Approach
Once creating an account, the user can browse through a collection of posts sorted by issues, job forms, and blogs. The user can also write up a post for others
to view. In addition, there will be data visualizers that we can create by getting public statistical data (examples: Daily Traffic, Hawaii Homeless, etc).

Search: Users can search for tags 

Daily Statistics: Statistics of local Company stocks and sales, as well as other local statistics

Tags: We can implement tags so that users can filter out topics that they want to specifically want to discuss.

Photos: Photos and images can be uploaded for each post so that other users can view and understand what the post is talking about etc.


Some mockup pages include:
- Landing page
- Login/Registration Page
- Statistic Page
- User Home Page
- Browser Page 
- Profile Page


## Use Case Ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

- A new user can create and register for an account
- Users can log in into and can access browser page, a profile page, and landing page
- Users can write up forms and add tags for it 
- Users can like and save a post 
- Users can logout 

## Beyond the Basics
Once a minimum viable product is achieved we can implement:
- Google Maps API
- Data Visualization
- Stripe for Transactions
- Mobile Client React Native
