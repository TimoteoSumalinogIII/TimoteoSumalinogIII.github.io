## Overview
The problem: One thing that I noticed that the people of Hawaii lack communication. Issues arise each day and people accross the island are sometimes
not informed. Furthermore, people don't express their opinions as much throughout our community. Also, we all know that Hawaii cost of living is really
expensive, thus having people post freelance work can possible combat this. Overall, more communication throughout our community will allow us to resolve 
stay informed of local trends, issues and oppurtites and overall feel like one big Ohana.


The solution: A community based platform that host forms and blogs that local Hawaiian people can post and review.

S


## Approach
Once creating an account, the user can browse through a collection of post sorted by issues, job forms, and blogs. The user can also write up post for others
to view. In addition, there will be data visualizers that we can create by getting public stastical data (examples: Daily Traffic, Hawaii Homeless, etc).

Some mockup pages include:
- Landing page
- Login/Registration Page
- Statistic Page
- User Home Page
- Browser Page
- Profile Page


## Beyond the Basics
Once a minimum viable product is achieved we can implment:
- Google Maps API
- Data Visulization
- Stripe for Transactions
- Mobile Client React Native
