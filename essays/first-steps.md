## My Software Engineering Experience so Far
My very first steps into Software Engineering was none other than Web Development. However, throughout my few years of venturing through the Computer Science field, I was able to learn and develop new skills mainly through the participation of Hackathons and Game Jams. I always try to explore various languages and developing software as I love to learn new things. A good example is in my first 24 hours Hackathon Hack4Edu, I was forced to learn Augmented Reality using Unity. It was daunting at first because my whole team’s knowledge and the experience was purely limited to basic Web Development. I decided that I would work on the Augmented Reality aspect while my colleagues would work on the website. It was because of that moment, using Unity, was I able to strengthen my passion for Computer Science. I played around with Unity, curious to every bit but I was constantly engaged. Even in the present I still use Unity and it was all thanks to my past self taking the initiative to explore new things. Another example would be how I learned Flutter during another hackathon to create a mobile catalog for birds. This made me want to continue expanding my Mobile Development experience with Flutter.

## My Interest in Artificial Intelligence 
The number one thing I hope to learn and master through the course of the UH Manoa ICS Program is Artificial Intelligence. As a child, I always love the idea of having robotics beings or having some form of Artificial Life. Also, I was interested in Artificial Intelligence mastering and surpassing us humans in various games. For instance, Google’s AlphaGo AI was unbeatable in the classic board game Go. It defeated the 18th time world Go Champion 4 times out of 5. Boundaries were than shattered as AI now was able to play popular more complex games such as Starcraft 2 and Dota 2. What grabbed my attention was using AI for self-driving cars. This is revolutionary, especially with other possible implementation of AI in different industries. The possible use of AI to help humanity is limitless and I want to take part in it!

## Final Thoughts
A Software Engineer’s journey is rough especially when they are taking their first steps. But this experience is natural as there will be a lot of obstacles but those are only meant to challenge us and make us better than we were yesterday. It is always a learning experience as new technologies come out further expanding potential projects. Hence, why Software Engineering itself is a big field that requires a variety of skill sets. We are not just limited to tech skills as you can make software about music requiring musical skills etc. Overall, Software Engineering is our sandbox in which limits are unparalleled but restricted to our imagination and creativity.
