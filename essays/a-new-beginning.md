## All Good Things Come to an End
Here we are at the end of the semester. My software engineering class was a rough ride but I learned so much and had lots of fun. Coming in with prior web developing experience, I wasn’t expecting much but boy was I wrong. I learned a new styling framework and a new deployment platform and many other fundamental aspects. These concepts I learned not only improved my web developing skills but also honed my experience as a software engineer. The applications go beyond web development covering all forms of software development. The main concepts that I want to highlight are the Coding Standards and Ethics.

## You Gotta Have Standards!
A very important aspect of Software Engineering that I hold deeply is to follow and implement Coding Standards. Coding Standards are a structure of agreed-upon rules that a company follows and withhold. In other words, they are a means to keep consistency throughout the work environment. For instance, we all have our ways of coding, our style, and our grammar. Some programmers prefer to camel case variables while others prefer to kebob case. Mixing any set of different coding practices is a recipe for disaster. It will make projects harder to understand and possibly prolong due dates. This is due to how hard it is for someone else to read and debug other’s code. A good way to illustrate and visualize this is to think about how Americans, Australians, Canadians, and British people speak. They all speak English but they all have their distinct slang and rules. When one of them says a certain slang to another, it can confuse the person they are talking to. The same idea applies here. Now, these coding standards are meant to prevent all that. Programmers are meant to follow these standards to understand how they should format and write their programs. Throughout my software engineering class, we used a tool called Es-lint which helped format our code to a specific standard. At first, we all wondered why do we need this, but once we transitioned to a group and collaborative assignments and projects we all understood the efficiency of it. Reading other student's code never felt so easy and it allowed my group to develop fast and efficiently. At the end of the day, coding standards are something used throughout tech companies to help prevent issues and to promote efficient development, and from what I experienced from my software engineering class, I know to expect them.


## Stop and Think About the Ethics
Ethics in software engineering is something I haven’t thought too much about when I first got into programming. I was so amazed at what programming can do that I forgot that we should be considerate of those who are using our programs and software. It is very easy to overlook and neglect problematic issues that could arise in the future. With that being said, this concept I learned in my software engineering class is a great one and an important one. There is that saying to create with the customer in mind, which I feel to be true. But we must consider the ethics behind it. For instance, a common issue is companies selling private data for profit. This is highly unethical and needs to be treated seriously. Even something small as a bug can easily be harmful to our audiences and consumers. The scope of these concepts is vast and goes beyond the ground of software engineering.  Ethics is something to keep in mind and is something we should never forget. It is ethical to think ethically.


## Let my Journey Begin! 
After gaining so much from my software engineering class I am really sad to see it end. But as the title suggests it is the start of a new beginning. I have so much more to learn and experience when it comes to software engineering, and I can’t wait to dive further in this amazing world my professor has shared. I like to think of software development as a form of art. A blank canvas in which we programmers are free to express and create what we want. To then take pride in our creations. That what it means to be a Software Engineer. Arriving late to the first day of my Software Engineering class, my Professor asked me “What is your passion?”. I am now glad to say that I have finally found it.
