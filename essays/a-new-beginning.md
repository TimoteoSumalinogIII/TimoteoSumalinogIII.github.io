## All Good Things Come to an End
Here we are at the end of the semester. My software engineering class was a rough ride but I learned so much and had lots of fun. 
Comming in with prior web developing experience, I wasn't expecting much but boy was I wrong. I learned a new styling framework and
a new deployment platform and many other fundamental aspects. These concepts I learnred not only improved my web developing skills but 
also honed my experience as a software engineer. The applications go beyond web developing covering all forms of software developing. 
These main concepts that I want to highlight are Coding Standards and the Ethics.


## You Gotta Have Standards!
A very important aspect of Software Engineering that I hold deeply is to follow and implement Coding Standards. Coding Standards are a structure of 
agreed upon rules that a company follow and withold. In other words, they are a means to keep consistency throughout the work enviroment. For instance, we all have our own ways of coding, our own style, and our own grammar. Some programmers prefer to camel case variables while other prefer to kebob case. Mixing any set of different coding practices is a recipe for disaster. It will make projects harder to understand and possibly prolong due dates. This is due to how hard it is for somone else to read and debug other's code. A good way to illustarte and visualize this is to think about how Americans, Austriallias, Candians and British people speak. They all are speak english but they all have their distinct slang and rules. When one of them says a certain slang to another, it can cause confusion. Same idea applies here. Now these coding standards are meant to prevent all that. Programmers are meant to follow these standards to understand how they should format and write their programs. Throughout my software enginnering class, we used a tool called Es-lint which helped format our code to a specfific standard. At first we all wondered why do we need this, but once we transistioned to group and collbaritve assignments and projects we all understood the efficenty of it. Reading other students code never felt so easy and it allowed my group to develop fast and efficent. At the end of the day, coding standards is something used throughout tech compaines to help prevent issues and to promote efficent development, and from what I expeieneced from my software engineering class, I know to expect them.


## Stop and Think About the Ethics
Ethics in software enginnering is something I haven't thought too much about when I first got in to programming. I was so amazed at what programming can do that I forgot that we should be considerate to those who are using our programs and software. It is very easy to overlook and negelect problemlatic issues that could arise in the future. With that being said, this concept I learned in my software enginnering class is a great one and an important one. There is that saying to create with the customer in mind, which I feel to be true. But we most consider the ethics behind it. For instance, a common issue is companies selling private data for profit. This is highly unethical and needs to be treated seriously. 


## Let my Journey Begin! 
After gaining so much from my software enginnring class I am really sad to see it end. But as the title sugggest it is a start of a new beginning. I have so much more to learn and experience when it comes to software engineering, and I can't wait to dive further in this amazing world my professor has shared. I like to think of software developing as a form of art. A blank canvas in which we programmers are free to express and create what we want. To then take pride in our creations. That what it means to be a Software Engineer. Arriving late to my first day of my Software Engineering class, my Professor asked me "What is your passion?". I am now glad to say that I have finally found it.
