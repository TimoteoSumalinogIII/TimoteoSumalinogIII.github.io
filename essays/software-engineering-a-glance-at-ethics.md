## The Hidden Ethics
Ethics in the world of software engineering can be very clear but sometimes it may not be too obvious. A good example is
storing private data without the user's consent. This is unethical. But something unethical that isn't too obvious would be having software bugs in your application that can impact someone's life. For instance, let's say
someone in the hospital was in critical condition and needs urgent help, but in the monitor, it gives readings of a healthy person, and this is all caused to your "bug/glitch". The violation of ethics, in this case, would be
the software engineer's neglecting some issues. When creating a product, bugs are bound to happen. However, we always test and release patch/software updates to help combat this. This is where the grey line hits. We are humans that aren't perfect
and the machines we create are just as flawed as we are. 


## The Greyness of Ethics
As I mentioned previously ethics can be sometimes grey. It's the fine line of whether or not is this ethical? It is really
hard to say but it mostly comes up to what you heartfully believe is right and wrong. Take for example in the case
where you work for the government and you are task at creating public software that's intention is to store and analyze any data that users input. This ranges from all data, public and private. The government is doing this
because they are trying to actively be ahead of terrorism. Trying to stop it before it even starts. Now you may think
that this software is doing good by protecting the people, but at the same time, you feel that the privacy that citizens
rightfully have is being breached. This is commonly seen with the government, FBI, and NSA. Events that occurred such as Edward Snowden leaking information from the NSA, in regards to security/surveillance at the cost of our privacy.
The greyness behind ethics comes from how it houses both a good and an evil perspective but it all depends on the eye of 
the beholder.


## The Ethics within the Machines we Create 
Self-driving cars are no stranger, in fact, for some, they are viewed as the future. The innovative company Tesla, which is the leading company in electric vehicles is pushing to new heights in Autonomous and Eco-friendly Vehicles. Self-driving 
features are advertised as a safe alternative to driving. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. Many people die even due to this
feature. This is due to how machines are created by us humans, and we humans can easily neglect or forget to make important changes or add important features. Thus, machines are just as equally flawed as their creators. It is always been said that
in an ideal society, everyone would be using these electric self-driving cars. This could be viewed true in various perspectives
but another issue besides death counts would be how these cars would be hackable. This can cause a lot of other dangers
and even a possibility of terrorism. But now let's look at the lesser evil, the good side. According to an article "Hands off the
Wheel", written by Bill Whitaker on CBS News, "More than 33,000 people die of car accidents due to human error...". This is where
the ideology of developing machines that can be viewed superior in some ways compared to humans can help reduce if not remove
accidents. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with this, it's someone's idea of a solution to help better society. But behind
this idea lies many ethical issues, one that I can think of is would you put the lives of others and yourself in the hands of a machine, let alone a machine created by someone else? Its thoughts like this and the unique values within each individual that will keep continuing to keep ethics controversial and important.
