## Why be Smart with Smart Questions?

"Smart Questions" are essential in the world of Computer Science because no matter what we do we will always run into problems and bugs. Not asking smart questions on community based forms such as Stack Overflow makes it harder for other people to provide help or an explanation to your issue. Thus being detailed and explicit with what your problem helps everyone save time and find a efficent and proper solution. Furthermore, one does not want to ask questions that may have been already answered or can easily be solved by looking up documentation. Questions like these are commonly ignored and downvoted. These questions are heavily reduent as they are common questions that people may have and aren't worth the time to constantly provide an answer for.


## A Smart Question that looks smart!



## Bad Example of a Smart Question 
(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59998498/is-there-any-clearing-tool-in-google-map-api-which-deletes-all-the-shapes-coming">Question Link</a>)
From the looks of this question, the person appears to be requesting someone to code something for him rather than having a clear in depth question. He doesn't clearly specify what he wants to remove and he doesn't specifify how exactly he wants his erasing tool to work. This is further supported by one of the comments asking "Can you be more precise on what you desire by this behavior clearing tool that will clear the area under selection? Clear (remove) what exactly?" and by the fact that this post (at the momemnt I have viewed it) has a downvote. As a result, his question is too general and it would be be inefficent to provide possible solutions as he/she may later say that its not what he/she is looking for.
