## Why be Smart with Smart Questions?

"Smart Questions" are essential in the world of Computer Science because no matter what we do we will always run into problems and bugs and typically questions to lead to answers. The lack of smart questions on community-based forms such as Stack Overflow makes it harder for readers to provide assistance or an explanation to your issue. Thus being detailed and explicit with what your problem helps everyone save time and find an efficient and proper solution. Furthermore, one does not want to ask questions that may have been already answered or can easily be solved by looking up documentation. Questions like these are commonly ignored and downvoted. These questions are heavily redundant as they are common questions that people may have had and are not worth the time to constantly provide an answer for.

It is not too late to adapt your critical thinking skills to invoke smart questions. A good habit to ensure that you maintain consistency is to always check if your question has been already answered with a simple search. This provides you with either, A) a solution or B) a better understanding of what your problem is. Now let's say you are unfortunate to fall into option B. Fear not! Being able to understand your problem better will allow you to post a more detailed and illustrative picture for your audience. This can be strengthened by providing the source code as well as providing the output/error for the program. These visual aids will allow the audience to tackle the issue from different angles and for some, it is way easier to just look at the code rather than having someone explain it. There is that general rule, explain a concept as if you are explaining to a 5-year-old. This idea remains the same as you want to be very detailed as possible especially since the world of programming feels nearly infinite. Overall, asking smart questions is truly a smart decision for not just you but everyone.



## A Smart Question that looks smart!

Here is a good example of a smart question that covers many key elements that make it descriptive and easy to follow. One thing I want to point out is that the poster did a fantastic job of referencing other Stack Overflow posts to help the readers build a better understanding of what exactly he/she needs assistance with. It also shows that he took the courtesy to look up the problem first rather than immediately posting. Furthermore, he added a link to the source code along with charts displaying the outputs. This helps the reader develop a stronger understanding of what he wants to implement and it gives the reader an idea of where the poster is so far. Overall, this post is a wonderful example of a smart question that truly deserves the 47 upvotes and descriptive answer.   


## Bad Example of a Smart Question

At a glance, this post appears to be requesting someone to code something rather than asking a clear in-depth question. The poster doesn't specify what he wants to remove and he doesn't explain how he wants his erasing tool to work. This is further supported by one of the comments asking "Can you be more precise on what you desire by this behavior clearing tool that will clear the area under selection? Clear (remove) what exactly?", and by the fact that this post (at the moment I have viewed it) has a downvote. As a result, this question post is too general and it would be inefficient to provide multiple possible solutions as it may not satisfy what exactly the user is looking for.
