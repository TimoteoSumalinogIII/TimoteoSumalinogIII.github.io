## Why standards?
Writing code is just like writing an essay. If there is no consitency or proper grammar it becomes diffuclt to understand. Now view this in a collabratice perspective, you may notice some potential issues. When someone tries to go through your code to review or debug it, it may be diffcult if the code is not formatted properly.    

## My Expereince With Coding Standards
When I preivously worked in teams, we would try to make our own coding standards but it would end up failing because we didn't enforce it or have some kind of extenstion to ensure our program meets our agreed standard. In addition, I have once used an extension called "Beautify" and I was not comfortable using it. When ever there was some sort of formating error, the whole website or program would not compile/run. However, my expereince with Eslint has been quite enjoyable. At first I did hate it because the highlight marks would bug me, but overtime I got use to it and I am glad that it would catch me everytime I have improper format. It made me feel more organized and I am confident that it will continue to help me keep my programming format consistent.
