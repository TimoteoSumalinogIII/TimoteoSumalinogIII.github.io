## Why standards?
Writing code is just like writing an essay. If there is no consistency or proper grammar it becomes difficult to understand. Now view this from a collaborative perspective, you may notice some potential issues. When someone tries to go through your code to review or debug it, it may be difficult if the code is not formatted properly. Even when working solo it can be an issue. It may be hard to find things in the future and you may end up being lost in your code. Hence, the implementation of a coding standard will prevent these potential issues. A coding standard is a set of guidelines that dictate how the format of your code will look like. This is very efficient when working with teams since the format for everyone's script will look the same, making it not only easier to read but also keeping the project more organized.

## My Expereince With Coding Standards
When I previously worked in teams, we would try to make our coding standards but it would end up failing because we didn't enforce it or have some kind of extension to ensure our program meets our agreed standard. Also, I have once used an extension called "Beautify" and I was not comfortable using it. Whenever there was some sort of formatting error, the whole website or program would not compile/run. However, my experience with Eslint has been quite enjoyable. At first, I did hate it because the highlight marks would bug me, but over time I got used to it and I am glad that it would catch me every time I have improper format. It made me feel more organized and I am confident that it will continue to help me keep my programming format consistent.

## Final Thoughts
I feel that implementing a consistent coding standard will be very useful when working with teams in the future. Looking at a teammate's script will feel like looking at your own. This will save so much time when it comes to debugging and troubleshooting. Overall, at first, people may not like it but over time they will begin to get used to it and may even end up loving it!
