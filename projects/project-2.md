WHS Devs is a web application that I helped create as a team project in my highschool programming class. The purpose of this project is to give recognition to Waipahu High School Business Partners and to provide our client with a dashboard in which she can organize data in relation to donations and partners in an easy and efficent matter. While interviewing her, she mentioned how she would have business partners and special guest fill out a google form in which she later puts onto a google sheet. This process is very tedious and inefficient, hence our idea of implmenting an admin dahboard, in which she can easy manage the website and oraganize data. This website is currently MVP and may be revisited in the future.

In this project I was in charge of backend database programming and the UI Design. I created and setup the database using Google Firebase and I tested posting, deleting, and retrieving data from the database. This then lead to the implementation of the login system. New users would create an account and login when they needed to clock in our provide business information. These were all stored in Firestore. For the UI Design I had to play around with Materialize since it was relatively new to me. I experimented with different layouts and color schemes until I found that one that look perfect. 


I learned many things throughout the course of the project ranging from soft skills to technical skills. In terms of soft skills, communication is without a doubt the most imporant aspect in not only a team but when dealing with a client. There would be times where we weren't able to fully understand what our client wanted and that resulted in dissatisfaction. We began to realize that it is best to always stay update to date with our client and to not heistate if there is any need for clarifcations. In terms of technical skills, I learned how to use Google Firebase to setup databases and to create a login system. Backend programming is an essential skill in software engineering, especially when projects deal with user data. Furthermore, I learned Materalize which is a CSS Libaray in which I have access to custom CSS elements that helps make styling easier and faster.
